# Hi, I'm Mikiyas Kiflu 👋

I'm an Electrical and Computer Engineering graduate with a growing passion for Data Science and real-world problem solving.

I specialize in data analysis using Python, with hands-on experience in projects like sales analytics and stock market forecasting. I enjoy turning raw data into insights using tools like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Jupyter Notebooks.

I'm especially interested in using data to support development in Ethiopia and beyond. Currently expanding my skills in machine learning and data storytelling.

📍 Based in Ethiopia | 🚀 Always learning | 🤝 Open to collaboration
